4 Player Chess:
Rules: 
2 v 2, once any player on a team is mated --> game ends
pawn promote on 11th rank
red, then clockwise
Some observations:
Castling is harder --> performing an earlier castle may be important
 - an early castle break can occur w/ moving a king's pawn when the player clockwise (after you) already moved his 
   - on the flipside, this also means, you should not move king's pawn if the previous player moved his
Teammate's pieces count as protection for taking pieces
Turn based system means you can get free pieces if your teammate checks, and then you position yourself to take a pieces
  from the checked player. 
Checkmates only occur when it gets to the player in checkmate (allows partner to move and prevent)
An interesting opening trap: move king pawn, next player moves queen pawn (maybe necessary idk), teammate moves king pawn
 - if the other player moves king pawn --> game ends (queen takes queen, teammate bishop to protect)
